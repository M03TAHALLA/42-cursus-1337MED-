# Push_swap Project 🌟

Welcome to the **Push_swap** project, a sorting algorithm challenge designed to strengthen your understanding of algorithm complexity and C programming. This project focuses on sorting data stored in stacks using a limited set of operations while striving for optimal efficiency.

## 📊 Project Overview
This project challenges you to sort integers on a stack with minimal operations. You must implement efficient sorting algorithms and carefully select the most appropriate approach based on the input configuration.

### Key Objectives:
- Master sorting algorithms and understand their complexities.
- Write clean and efficient C code.
- Learn optimization techniques and improve problem-solving skills.
- Handle large datasets with precision and speed.

## 🗒️ How the Project Works
Push_swap involves two stacks:
- **Stack A:** Initially contains the unsorted integers.
- **Stack B:** Used as an auxiliary stack during the sorting process.

Your task is to develop sorting algorithms and execute operations such as:
- `sa`, `sb`, `ss`: Swap the first two elements of a stack.
- `pa`, `pb`: Push the top element from one stack to another.
- `ra`, `rb`, `rr`: Rotate the stack upward.
- `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr`: Rotate the stack downward.

You will need to combine these operations efficiently to achieve the sorted state with minimal moves.

## 🔧 Algorithms Implemented
### Sorting Algorithm Strategies:
- **Small Dataset Strategy:** Direct sorting techniques for up to five elements.
- **Chunk-based Sorting:** Dividing the stack into chunks for larger datasets.
- **Optimized Sorting:** Algorithm selection based on the size and configuration of the dataset.
